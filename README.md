# shoppingList
Manage shopping list in a spreadsheet. Python app compiles it and prints to a receipt printer.  Best-Tech!!

I'm tired of cloud-based, cellphone-centric attempts at making the shopping experience 'easier'. Fact of the matter is, they don't. What they do is hoard the record of our shopping habits, and use that data in who knows what way.

I've found a much simpler way to create and use the weekly shopping list (as well as the random list). This is spouse-approved, so I know it really is a better way.

We created a database in an Excel .xlsx file.  I wrote this Python Tkinter app that runs in Windows to scan the database and compile all the records that have a quantity of 1 or higher.

Then it prints to a receipt printer, which is the most awesome thing ever.  My spouse absolutely loves this, because it is so much easier to manage than her cellphone in the grocery store.

I call this "Best-Tech" because it may not be exactly cool, and you might not call it 'high-tech', but it sure is the best way we've ever found to quickly and easily create the shopping list for all of our various shopping trips.
